  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(0), `<b>HUGE UPDATE EVERYONE</b>
I just witnessed a cape fight IRL!! The absolute coolest thing I've ever seen - no contest. Okay, getting SteelSalamander's autograph was pretty cool, too. BUT THIS WAS EPIC!
I know you're all dying to see my analysis, but it'll take a bit to put together. I just had to share this with you all ASAP!! Will report back with the analysis soon ðŸ¤©`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(40, 2), `Sorry for the delay, everyone! It took longer than I thought to put this together. I'm still feeling a little off from things, for some reason.
I'll be posting the analysis in a few parts, starting with something I don't normally get to analyze: how the fight started! Normally these cape fights are recorded after they begin, but I happened to be nearby right when it kicked off ðŸ˜ƒ`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(1), `<b>Analysis Part 1:</b> How the Fight Started
<b>When:</b> August 17th, 1:20 PM
<b>Location:</b> 3rd and Maybrook St, Westfield

<b>Description:</b>
I was just walking out of the hobby shop carrying a new model kit, when I nearly bumped into this family arguing outside the door. Aside from the parents, there were two girls and a boy, and all looked around middle or early high school age. The parents must've given the younger girl some cash because she was grasping a decent-sized chunk of bills, which she was proffering to the boy. He lurched back as she tried to press it into his hand though, ripping his arm way, and I heard him undertone something about 'not needing anything' as I walked past. I suspected the boy had just reached the age where he thought he was too cool for toys. It seemed like I was right, because the older girl sighed theatrically and walked into the store. The mom told the other two kids to join them inside soon, and the parents followed the older kid inside. I chuckled and started my walk home, and was about to cross the intersection when I heard some shouting from behind me. I thought it was just the kids arguing, but when I turned around, I saw that a car had pulled up outside the store. A couple of men had gotten out, and they were uncomfortably close to the kids. I didn't pick up what exactly they'd said, but it looked like they were trying to get the girl to hand over the money. Now, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself if I didn't do something to help, but these were three fully grown men - it's not like I could've just stepped in. I was just about to call the police, when I saw the boy step right up to one of the thugs. He was shorter than them by at least a foot, but he was posturing like he was the one with a 50 pound advantage. The punks laughed, and the one in front gave him a hard shove. I expected the kid to go flying, terrified he'd hit his head on the sidewalk. Any normal kid would have, but the boy stayed rooted in place, didn't even stumble, and just glared up at the confused brute. There was a second or two of silence, while the girl looked worriedly back and forth between the two of them. Then, a slim, skeevy looking goon leaped forward and snatched the money from the girls hand. That turned out to be a serious mistake.

<b>Analysis:</b>
- It appears that the cape (Grip), was provoked in this case. However, given that he stood up for the girl, I'm more inclined to believe this means he's a hero or rogue rather than a villain. 
- Grip deifinitely has some relation to the family, but I couldn't be sure whether he's a member or friend. I didn't notice any strong resemebalance, but that doesn't mean much, espeically for a [PP].
- Grip lives up to his name. It seems like he has some power related to staying in place, but the source in unclear. He has no noticeable changes in morphology, though.`),

<b>Description:</b>
The change was instant. One second, the lanky thug was laughing and lording the cash high over the kid's heads, the next, the bills were green confetti fluttering to the ground, and the creep was thudding into the car hard enough to dent the door. The kid's arm was still raised; a threat to anyone stupid enough to try him. The other two jumped back, and the chubbier, shorter one looked uncertainly at the bigger brute - their leader, I guessed. He reached into his pocket and flipped open a butterfly knife, a wry sneer curling up his lips. That's when I rememered to pull out my phone. The girl gasped at the knife, and started yelling at the thugs to leave them alone, that the money was theirs. When that didn't have any effect, she tried pulling at the boy, who didn't seem to notice. He took two quick steps forward, slinging his arm towards the thug with the momentum. The kid's hand met the villain's throat in an instant, even though they were at least 5 feet apart. The man lashed out wildly with the knife as he gasped for breath, and it lodged into the side of the kid's elongated forearm. 
It was at this moment that I finally put two and two together: "This is Grip!", I realized. My excitment turned quickly to worry, as the arm spasmed and nearly dropped the squiriming delinquent. Grip let out a grunt of pain, and began to lift the man single-handedly into the air, who was clawing at the hand around his throat and gasping for breath. The other grunt made what can only be described as a suicidal rush towards Grip, who didn't even turn his head as he slammed his plam onto the thug's bare chest, who was wearing a disgustingly sweaty and low-hanging tank top. Instead of flying back though, the goon stopped dead in his tracks as he gasped for breath, clearly winded. Then, Grip turned and began walking towards a nearby alleyway, dragging both thugs behind him. His arms were clearly distended now, and bent strangely like they didn't have joints at all. The knife had fallen out, and a deep blue-ish blood was seeping from the wound. The moron who'd been bashed into the car started picking himself up. It must've been a feat of real strength, because he was clearly dazed and had a nasty bruise blossuming across his forehead. Still, he opened the bloodied car door and pulled out a metal baseball bat, before stumbling towards the alley. The girl shouted "Look out, behind you!", and by the way she was staring at the entrace to the alley, I could tell she desperately wanted to go follow herself. For whatever reason, she didn't. Fear, I guess. I realized with a shock that I hadn't called the cops yet, so I dialed 911 and began answering the operator's questions:
"What's your emergency?"
"A couple of thugs are fighting a kid."
"Are there any paramhuman abilities at use?"
"Yea, I think the kid they're fighting is Grip"
I heard a muffled cry from the alley - then nothing. Had one of them died? Was Grip okay? How long would it take this response team to arrive, and could they even help?
"Sir, are you there? Please confirm your location." 
"Shit, sorry. 3rd and Maybrook."
"Stay away from the danger. A parahuman response team will arrive at your location shortly."
There was a metallic 'clang' sound - had someone been hit with the bat? I was already walking over as they hung up. I knew it was dangerous. Stupid, even. But there was no way in hell that I was missing the chance to see the rest of the fight. When the girl saw me walking towards the alley, she overcame whatever was holding her back. She yelled out again "Someone's coming!", and rushed over to the entrace. Maybe I should've stopped, in retrospect. Maybe he has a power that could hurt bystanders, or maybe he wouldn't take kindly to someone seeing his un-masked face up close. I wasn't thinking about that at the time - I just had to see what was happening. As the alley came into view, the first thing I noticed was Grip fiddling with his long sleeves - I think he was rolling them down. It was only then that I noticed the three men on the ground. Unconcious, or maybe dead? It had only been a minute, two at most, and all three men were lying on the ground. I didn't see any blood though, other than the blue splotch that had bled through Grip's sleeve. The baseball bat lay on the ground - there was no trace of blood on that either. As I got closed though, I noticed that the thugs all had strange, circular red marks around their mouth and neck. The girl had run up to Grip, asking if he was okay. He was holding his wound now, but told her in a low voice that he was fine. Then he noticed me. I'd just pulled up my phone to take a picture, but I froze as he locked eyes with me. They were wrong - no iris at all, and the pupil wasn't quite the right shape. They were too colorless. Or maybe the rest of him was too colorful? He said something I didn't catch to the girl, who looked between me and him anxiously, before she ran back towards store. I remember feeling terrified now that I was alone with him, bodies littering the ground and those unnatural eyes pouring into me. I tried to speak, but the words wouldn't come. Then I think he said something I can't remember, but I know that I nodded. Then he blinked and gave me a half smile, and the tension began to leak back out of my body as I remembered to breath. Then he walked up, patted me on the shoulder, and said "Thanks, man". I didn't really know what I'd agreed to, but the kid was already focused on picking up scattered money off the ground. I could hear the sirens as I rounded the corner, headed back home.

<b>Analysis:</b>
- It's clear that Grip can do more than hold people down. He has some more generic form of super strength. However, he clearly has some propensity for lockdown-esque effects. I suspect that his super strength is less straightforward than other capes', though I don't have any meaningful contributions as to what it might be.
- As has been mentioned before, Grip has some sort of ability to stretch his arms. It wasn't clear how far he can stretch them, but they reached nearly doubled in length during this fight. They either aren't jointed as usual, or are able to bend more than normal, too.
- The blue blood indicates that Grip does have morphological changes after all. Maybe this is a biological augmention which allows his stretch and strength? Perhaps an amplified cardiovascular system and musculature? Hard to say for sure, but I think this is new info on Grip.
- The red marks on the thugs are interesting. They almost look like bruises, but they don't seem to be from any of the blows I saw. I think they might be some sort of side effect from Grip's power. Maybe some sort of poison application system? The criminals were knocked out or killed in less than 2 minutes, so whatever he used must've been fast acting.
- On that topic, Grip decapacitated three fully grown men very quickly, especially considering there was no bloodshed. This seems like a strong indicator that his powers can be used on multiple targets at once.
- Finally, I think it's worth mentioning that while I stand with my prior analysis that Grip is likely a hero or rogue, he seems to have a propensity for violence. Maybe this is why he's been seeking out fights. He was definitely provoked, but I can't shake the feeling I got from his eyes. Something feels off about him.

  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(2), `Not sure. I'd left before the cops got there, but I doubt it. Kid's avoided most attention until now.`),
  new Post("cf2", dt.offset(22), `Dang - not what I was expecting to read today, lol. Still don't understand why you didn't ask about his powers, motives, etc? Seems like you had a better chance than most, and you just walked away? Also, cmon, you've gotta remember what he said to you - just tell us man`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(5), `Yea, honestly IDK what I was thinking. Guess the fight was scarier than I thought - I was pretty shell-shocked. Took me a while to feel normal once I was home, too. I swear I don't remember what he said to me, though. I assume he just asked me not to reveal his identity or something? No clue how I forgot. Trust me, I'm kicking myself more than you could lol`),
  new Post("cf2", dt.offset(2), `Damn, that sucks. Wish I'd been there. Still, we got some good info! The red marks are new, and it's cool to get confirmation about the stretching! I was sure that was just <u>@NotAVillain</u>s imagination. I think the blood is a new thing too, right?`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(0), `Yea, I think so - don't think anyone's mentioned it before. Weird, right? I assumed he just had some sort of weight-related power before, like Jack, but clearly not. Really curious if anyone has an interesting take on it`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(7), `Nice post <u>@TinkerMind</u> - thanks for tag btw
You didn't get any pics outta it, right? Also, wasn't there a lot of yelling? Didn't anyone else, or the parents, notice?
Also, what's the deal with this family thing - do u think theyre related??`),
  new Post("cf2", dt.offset(1), `Good q, was wonderin the same myself - was the girl his sister or somethin?`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(0), `They coulda been siblings, cousins, or somethin else. Didn't really get a strong feeling either way. The girl was clearly important to him, though.
  
As for the yelling, it was pretty loud inside the store bc. of the tourney this weekend, and you know that part of town is mostly empty nowadays. It also really didn't last long, only a few minutes. There were a couple of shouts and loud noises, but it was quieter than I thought a fight would be tbh`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(3), `Hmm, very interesting
Girl seems to know about power, at least. Wonder what that stuff they said to eachother was about? Maybe doesn't want her to see violence?
I think I tentatively agree with the cardio theory - just dont see how the red rings fit in. Maybe he has some sort of blood related power - poisons people w/ that?
Fits the weird vibes you were gettin too lol`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(1), `That's a good idea!! I think you're onto something there.`),
  new Post("cf2", dt.offset(0), `Ohhh, now you're thinkin with portals, haha
Best theory we've got so far, I think!

Also, do you have a better description of Grip? Sounds like you got a good look at him`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(4), `So that's the thing, I definitely did, but I can't seem to recall much of that, either ðŸ˜…
They say you're supposed to remember everything in scary situations, but that definitely wasn't the case for me, lol
He was definitiely middle-school aged, maybe 14? But other than him being male and wearing long sleeves, I can't remember, not even his race. Sorry yall :/`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(1), `Ur just colorblind LOL, good for you - but seriously were you high XD`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(0), `Nah, haha. I was just really focused on the fight I guess`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(1), `Whack. Speakin of, what was the deal with the whole 'eye' thing? Was he just scarier than you thought a kid could be, or what?`),
  new Post('tkm', dt.offset(0), `No, it wasn't that - there was definitely something to it. Gave me a weird feeling.`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(1), `Interesting. Maybe he was using some sort of power?`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(1), `Maybe some sort of intimidation power? I didn't think so, but it's not like I'd know what that's like, lol`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(0), `Yea, I guess. Seems like a stretch LOLLL`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(0), `XD
Ugh, now I can't wait for the next sighting of him, but that'll probably take agessss`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(1), `Yea same lol. Also, what model didya get?`),
  new Post("tkm", dt.offset(0), `The new Splicer model :)
The detailing is really good - they even got the little scar on his chin!`),
  new Post("nav", dt.offset(1), `Niceeee, will have to pick that one up at some point`),
